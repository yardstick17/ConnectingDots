## Project Content

[Perceptron][perceptron]: The very basic entity in Machine Learning. It's training and weights update in code. Find more [here](http://amitkushwaha.co.in/understanding-cnn.html)

[Image Aesthetic Assessment][image_aesthetic_ref]: Determining the aesthetic content of an image. The network defined use Spatial Pyramid Pooling. Find more [here](http://amitkushwaha.co.in/image-aesthetic-assessment.html)

[Image Classification][image_classification]: Alexnet architecture in Keras for image classification. Find more [here](http://amitkushwaha.co.in/image-classification.html)
